title: Getting Started with True Market
---

Learn how to connect your wallet and place your first trade.

## Getting Started

True Market uses **MetaMask** for authentication and transaction signing. You do not need to install a separate Linera wallet.

## Connecting Your Wallet

**Step 1: Install MetaMask**
Ensure you have the [MetaMask browser extension](https://metamask.io/) installed.

**Step 2: Visit True Market**
Navigate to the True Market dashboard.

**Step 3: Click Connect**
Click the "Connect Wallet" button. Select **MetaMask** from the popup.

**Step 4: Sign to Authenticate**
You will be asked to sign a message to prove ownership of your address. This does not cost any gas.

**That's It!** You are now logged in.

## Getting Tokens

To trade, you will need the platform's native test tokens.
* If you are on the **Testnet**, visit the **Faucet** page in the dashboard to claim free tokens.

## Your First Trade (Buy Only)

*Note: Currently, only **Buying** is supported. Selling and Claiming will be enabled in the next update.*

1. **Browse Markets** - Find a topic that interests you.
2. **Select Outcome** - Choose "YES" or "NO".
3. **Buy Shares** - Enter the amount and confirm the transaction in MetaMask.
4. **Monitor** - Watch your position in the Portfolio tab.
