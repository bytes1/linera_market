Common questions and solutions.

## Common Issues

### "Connection Failed"

**Problem:** MetaMask won't connect.
**Solution:**
- Refresh the page.
- Ensure you are not on a restricted network (VPN might be needed in some regions).
- Unlock MetaMask before clicking "Connect".

### "Sell Button Disabled"

**Problem:** I cannot sell my shares.
**Reason:** True Market is currently in Phase 1 MVP. Only **Buying** is implemented. **Selling** will be available in the next update.

### "How do I claim my winnings?"

**Answer:** The Claim functionality is part of the Phase 2 update. For this testing phase, markets may not resolve automatically.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which wallet do I need?
You need **MetaMask**. We use it to sign transactions for the Linera network.

### Why is everything on one chain?
We are currently using a **single-chain architecture** for the MVP to ensure stability. The next update will migrate to a **multi-chain model** where every market runs on its own dedicated Linera microchain for maximum scalability.

### Can I trade 24/7?
Yes, the specific "Buy" operations are available 24/7.

### Is this real money?
If you are using the Testnet/Devnet, the tokens are for testing purposes only and have no real-world value.
