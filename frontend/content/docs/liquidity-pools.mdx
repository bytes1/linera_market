Learn how to provide liquidity to prediction markets and earn fees.

## Liquidity Pools (AMM)

True Market relies on **Liquidity Providers (LPs)** to facilitate trading. Instead of matching buyers and sellers directly, the contract holds a pool of assets. Traders trade against this pool.

## How It Works

When you create a market or add liquidity:

1. You deposit tokens to bootstrap the market.
2. **Initial Liquidity:** This establishes the initial probability (usually 50/50).
3. **LP Tokens:** You receive LP shares representing your ownership of the pool.
4. **Fee Accumulation:** As people trade, a fee is charged and added to the pool's reserves.
5. **Redemption:** You can burn your LP tokens to withdraw your original deposit plus your share of the accumulated fees.

## Adding Liquidity to Existing Markets

**Step 1:** Find a market you want to support.

**Step 2:** Click "Add Liquidity".

**Step 3:** Specify how much to deposit.

**Step 4:** Confirm the transaction.

**Step 5:** Earn passive yield from trading volume.

## LP Token Value

Your LP tokens represent a claim on the entire market pool.
- **Pool Grows:** Every trade adds a small fee to the pool, increasing the value of each LP token over time.
- **Impermanent Loss:** If the market probability moves significantly from when you deposited, your LP value might be lower than if you had just held the tokens. However, trading fees are designed to offset this risk.

## Fee Structure

The default trading fee is **3%** on all trades, distributed as follows:

- **Treasury Fee:** 1% - Goes to the protocol treasury.
- **Liquidity Provider Fee:** 2% - Added directly to the pool, increasing the value of LP tokens.
- **Distributor/Creator Fee:** (Optional) Set by the market creator.

## Example Calculation

**Scenario:** You provide 100 Tokens to a market with 1000 Tokens total liquidity.

1. You own 10% of the liquidity pool.
2. Over time, 10,000 Tokens in trades occur.
3. **Fees Generated:** ~300 Tokens.
   - Treasury takes 100.
   - **Pool receives 200.**
4. The pool now has 1200 Tokens (ignoring price shifts).
5. Your 10% share is now worth **120 Tokens**.

## Removing Liquidity

You can withdraw your liquidity at any time:

1. Navigate to your liquidity positions.
2. Select "Remove Liquidity".
3. Choose percentage to withdraw.
4. Approve transaction.
5. Receive your share of the pool reserves.
