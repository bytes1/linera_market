Learn how to provide liquidity to prediction markets and earn fees.

## Liquidity Pools

Providing liquidity is one way to earn fees on True Market. When you add liquidity to a market, you receive LP tokens representing your share of fees and market movement.

## How It Works

When you create a market or add liquidity:

1. You deposit tokens to bootstrap the market
2. You receive LP tokens proportional to your contribution
3. As traders use the market, fees accumulate in the pool
4. You can redeem LP tokens for your share of fees and market value

## Adding Liquidity to Existing Markets

You can also add liquidity to markets created by others:

**Step 1:** Find a market you want to provide liquidity for

**Step 2:** Click "Add Liquidity"

**Step 3:** Specify how much to deposit

**Step 4:** Receive LP tokens in return

**Step 5:** Earn fees as the market trades

## LP Token Value

LP tokens represent:
- Your proportional share of liquidity pool reserves
- Your share of accumulated trading fees
- Exposure to market movements

As the market price moves, LP tokens may be worth more or less than your initial deposit.

## Fee Structure

Total trading fee is **3%** on all trades, distributed as follows:

- **Community Fee:** 1% - Goes to community treasury and platform development
- **Liquidity Provider Fee:** 2% - Distributed to liquidity providers based on their LP token share
- **Creator Fee:** 0-5% (market creator decides, separate from trading fee)

LP providers earn from the 2% liquidity provider fee pool. Your earnings depend on your proportion of total liquidity in the market.

**Example:** If a market has $1,000 in total liquidity and you provide $100 (10%), you earn 10% of all LP fees generated in that market.

## Removing Liquidity

You can withdraw your liquidity at any time:

1. Navigate to your liquidity positions
2. Select LP tokens to redeem
3. Choose how many to burn
4. Approve transaction in wallet
5. Receive your share of pool reserves + accumulated fees

## Impermanent Loss

Be aware of impermanent loss:
- When prices diverge significantly, LP value may decrease
- Compare LP earnings against potential price movements
- Consider market volatility before providing liquidity

## Example Calculation

**Scenario:** You provide 100 MOCA to a market with 1000 MOCA total liquidity

1. You own 10% of the liquidity pool (receive LP tokens reflecting this)
2. Over time, $10,000 in trades occur (3% fee = $300 in total fees)
   - Community receives: $100 (1%)
   - LP providers share: $200 (2%)
3. Your share of LP fees: $20 (10% of $200)
4. Your total value: 100 MOCA + $20 in fees
