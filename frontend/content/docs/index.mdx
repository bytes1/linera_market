Welcome to **True Market**, a decentralized prediction market platform built on the **Linera** blockchain.

## Introduction

True Market is a modern, open, and intelligent prediction market platform leveraging Linera's microchain architecture. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for creating markets, trading prediction shares, and engaging with decentralized forecasting.

**Permissionless & Scalable**

True Market uses Linera's multi-chain protocols to ensure permissionless market creation and infinite scalability. Unlike traditional blockchains where all trades compete for the same block space, Linera allows True Market to run on its own application microchains, ensuring low latency and high throughput.
