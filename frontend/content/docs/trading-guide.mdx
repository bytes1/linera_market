Learn how to participate in prediction markets.

## Trading Guide

True Market uses an **Automated Market Maker (AMM)**. Currently, the platform supports **Buying** positions. The ability to Sell and Claim winnings is coming in the next major update.

## Understanding Prices

Prices represent probability:
- **Price 0.75** = 75% probability.
- **Price 0.25** = 25% probability.

## Buying Shares (Implemented)

You can go "Long" on any outcome by buying shares.

**Step 1:** Select a market.

**Step 2:** Choose an outcome (e.g., "YES").

**Step 3:** Enter your investment amount.

**Step 4:** Review the estimated shares you will receive.

**Step 5:** Click **Buy**. MetaMask will prompt you to sign the transaction.

**Step 6:** Once confirmed, your shares are recorded on the Linera chain.

## Selling Shares (Coming Soon)

*This feature is currently under development.*

In the next update, you will be able to swap your shares back into the liquidity pool to exit your position before the market resolves.

## Market Resolution & Claiming (Coming Soon)

*This feature is currently under development.*

**How it will work:**
1. **Resolution:** When the event ends, the market will be "Resolved" to a specific outcome (YES or NO).
2. **Claiming:** If you hold shares of the winning outcome, you will be able to click **Redeem** to convert each share into 1.00 unit of currency.
3. **Losing Shares:** Shares of the losing outcome will become worthless.

## Position Management

You can view your current holdings in the **Portfolio** section. Currently, this is a read-only view of your active bets.
